=== Algorithm
. Launch the screen.
.. The main screen appears.
. getDeviceInfo is called to get the Device Name list of edge AI devices registered in the "**Console**".
. The gotten Device Name list of edge AI devices is set to the drop-down list.
. Import/Export label and set display labels for inference results.
.. Only label file data is gotten during label import. (The label file itself is not included.)
. Open the Display Setting menu and set display setting on the AI task tab

. Realtime Mode
.. Select the Device Name of the edge AI device from the Device Name drop-down list and press Start Upload.
.. startUploadInferenceResult is called to start uploading inference source images and inference results.
.. Set the Polling Interval and press the Start Polling button.
.. getImage and getInference are called periodically to get and display the latest inference source image and inference results.
* If the selected AI task is a classification, a list of inference results is also displayed.
.. When the Stop Upload button is pressed, stopUploadInferenceResult is called to stop uploading inference source images and inference results.
.. Press the Stop Polling button to stop getting and displaying the latest inference source image and inference results.
* If the selected AI task is a classification, the list of inference results is also stopped.

. History Mode
.. Select the Device Name of the edge AI device from the Device Name drop-down list.
.. getSubDirectoryList is called to get a list of subdirectories where the inference source images are stored.
.. The list of gotten subdirectories is set in a drop-down list.
.. Select the subdirectory from the Sub Directory drop-down list.
.. getTotalImageCount is called to get the number of inference source images stored in the selected subdirectory.
.. Set the Image Selection/Interval Time and press Start Playing.
.. getImage and getInference are called periodically to get and display the entire number of inference source images and their inference results, one by one, stored in the subdirectory.
* After getting and displaying the last inference source image and inference result of the subdirectory, start again with the first one.
* If the selected AI task is a classification, a list of inference results is also displayed.
.. Pressing the Stop Playing button stops getting and displaying inference source images and inference results.
* If the selected AI task is a classification, the list of inference results is also stopped.
.. Press the Save Data button to open the Save Data menu.
.. Select the data format you want to save from the Select Save Data radio button.
.. Move the Save Range slider to specify the range to save data.
.. Press the Save button.
.. The "Save File As" dialog appears.
* The user can select the name and destination of the file to be saved.
.. When the user selects a filename and destination to save and presses the "Save" button, the Saving dialog appears, displaying the format of the data to be saved, the progress of saving it, and the save progress bar.
* The save progress and save progress bar are updated from time to time.
* The progress at the time of saving is as follows:
** Starts saving: 0%
** Working directory creation and initialization complete: 20%
** Get and save inference source images complete: 50%
** Generating overlaid images: 60%
** Get, deserialize, and save inference results complete: 80%
** Generating zip file and getting zip data are complete: 100%

* You can cancel the save by pressing the Cancel button.
.. initializeDirectory is called to create a working directory for data saving.
** Creates the working directory under the name "work" under the src directory.
.. saveImage and saveInferences are called to save the specified range of inference source images and inference results to the working directory.
.. If you select Overlaid Image: + 
createOverlaidImage is called to create and save images by overlaying inference results/timestamp on the inference source images saved in the working directory. Overlaid images are created that reflects the label and Display Setting values set when the Save Data button is pressed.
.. createZip is called to create a zip file containing the saved inference source images and inference results in the working directory.
.. getZipData is called to get the data of the created zip file.
** The file structure of the zip file is as follows.
        
   yyyyMMddHHmmssSSS (1)      
      ∟yyyyMMddHHmmssSSS.jpg (2)
      ∟yyyyMMddHHmmssSSS.jpg (2)
      ∟yyyyMMddHHmmssSSS.json (3)
      ∟yyyyMMddHHmmssSSS.json (3)

   (1) Inference start time
   (2) Original Image: Inference source image file, Overlaid Image: Overlaid image file (The filename is the time at which the inference source image was output)
   (3) Inference results file (The filename is the time at which the inference source image was output)

.. Once the data is gotten, it is written to a user-specified destination file.
.. Once the data is written, the save progress is 100% and the save is complete.
** The data saved in the working directory is deleted when the working directory is initialized after the next saving process is started.
** The saved data that remains when the saving is canceled is similarly deleted when the working directory is initialized after the next saving process is started.

== Target performances/Impact on performances
* UI response time of 1.2 seconds or less
* If processing takes more than 5 seconds, then the display during processing can be updated sequentially

== Assumption/Restriction
* Semantic Segmentation is the only type of Segmentation supported this time.
* Display label settings for inference results are in the following JSON format (Refer to the following example).
** If the key name is different from the example, an error occurs during import.
** Labels must be in the order of class ID as detected by the AI model.
** Example for Object Detection/Classification

   {
      "label": [
         "Label_1",
         "Label_2",
         "Label_3"
      ]
   }

** Example for Segmentation

   {
      "labelList": [
         {
           "isVisible": true,
           "label": "Label_1",
           "color": "#000000"
         },
         {
           "isVisible": false,
           "label": "Label_2",
           "color": "#0000ff"
         },
         {
           "isVisible": true,
           "label": "Label_3",
           "color": "#ff0000"
         }
      ]
   }

* From the "**Console**" UI, set command parameter file to the following setting:
** Mode=1(Image&Inference Result)
** UploadMethodIR="Mqtt"
** Other parameters need to be changed depending on the AI model and application content.
* If you select an edge AI device that does not have an AI model or application deployed at runtime, it will not work properly.
* If you select an AI task that differs from the output data of the AI model, it may result in an error or incorrect data.
* If there are more than 1000 images in a subdirectory in History Mode or Realtime Mode, the playback order of the images may be disturbed.

== Remarks
* Image uploads from edge AI devices to the "**Console**" can experience delays of up to several minutes.

== Unconfirmed items
* None
